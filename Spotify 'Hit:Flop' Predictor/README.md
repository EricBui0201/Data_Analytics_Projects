# Spotify Hit/Flop Predictor
<img src="Images/img1.png" width="250">

### Objective
Develop an accurate Classification model that can predict whether a newly released song on Spotify could become a hit, i.e. a song that might be featured in the weekly billboard charts and potentially become popular in the mainstream.

#### Problem Definition
The dataset used in this project is retreived from Kaggle, consisting of more than 10K unique songs from 2000-2019 along with 15 features fetched from Spotify's Web API. The following link contains a detailed description of the features used to describe the songs in the dataset: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/. The biggest challenge is to transform my intial dataset into an optimized one through proper Feature Scaling and Engineering and choosing the right fit model that has the highest predictive power.
