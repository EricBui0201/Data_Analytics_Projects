# Airbnb Web Scraping
#### Main Objective
Conduct an exhaustive scraping on all stays available at Airbnb in the major cities of France, and perform a supply-demand analysis to come up with a supply management scheme to accurately meet market's need. Accordingly, this project will be divided into multiple tasks.

#### Task 1 - Problem Definition

- How is the website structured?
- What data is available for the user to scrape?
- How are the URL's structured?
- What is the best approach to scrape the website?
